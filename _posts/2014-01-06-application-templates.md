Rails 4 removed the option to override the behavior of the application builder, but we can use the Application Templates in order to customize the way our applications are created.

Rails has a [nice guide][1] to get started with app templates, but be sure to also check the [docs for Thor's actions][3].

You can look at the [application template][4] that we use at Platanus when we start a new project.
