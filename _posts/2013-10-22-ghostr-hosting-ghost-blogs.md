Do you like blogging? Have you heard about the new kid on the block? It's called [Ghost][1], and it's AWESOME. It's open source, and as you can see in its [github page][3], it has a super active community. We plan to be active contributors to that community as well.

The editor is badass: you write in [Markdown][2] on the left in a vertically splitted window, and on the right you instantly see a preview of your post.

We wanted to make it super easy to start using Ghost, so we created [Ghostr][4], a hosted platform where you can just start blogging. Would you like to know how it feels to use Ghost? You can use our [7 day free trial][4]!
